**Please Note!** The dates of our hackathon are partially colliding with a larger convention starting on the 7th of March. This means that hotel prices may rise significantly above their regular level. This regards in particular hotels nearby the institute, as the convention center is just across the street from the MPI. **To avoid overly high prices, book as soon as possible with the option for flexible cancellation!**
