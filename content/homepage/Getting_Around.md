The Netherlands is renowned for its excellent cycling infrastructure. If you'd like to take advantage of this during the hackathon, bikes are available for rent directly at the [WICC Hotel](https://www.wicc.nl/en/facilities/). 

Alternatively, public transport is also an option. Bus schedules and fare information are available online at [9292.nl](https://www.9292.nl/en), and tickets can be purchased on the bus.
