This will be the Hamburg node of the Digital Earths Global Hackathon.

The nextGEMS project has entered the production phase and the first global 30-year storm-resolving simulations of a future climate are ready to be analysed. Simulations from both the ICON and the IFS model are available. 

<!-- Some funding for [travel support](stipends_detail) (max. of 1000 € per person) is available for early career scientists. -->

<!-- The hazard hackathon will be the 5th km-scale hackathon in the nextGEMS project. -->

Please join us for one week of hacking, finding bugs, fixing bugs, and a lot of fun from 12th to 16th May 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.
