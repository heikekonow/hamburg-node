The nextGEMS project has entered the production phase and the first global 30-year storm-resolving simulations of a future climate are ready to be analysed. Simulations from both the ICON and the IFS model are available. 

The main hackathon themes are fire weather, (urban) heat extremes, and precipitation extremes. We are interested in validating and analyzing key indicators globally. We cordially invite scientists interested in these research themes to join a one-week hackathon in Wageningen, NL, from 14 to 18 October 2024. Some funding for [travel support](stipends_detail) (max. of 1000 € per person) is available for early career scientists.

<!-- The hazard hackathon will be the 5th km-scale hackathon in the nextGEMS project. -->

<!-- Please join us for one week of hacking, finding bugs, fixing bugs, and a lot of fun from 14th to 18th October 2024 in Wageningen, Germany. -->
