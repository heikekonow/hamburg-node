The hazard hackathon will be the 5th km-scale hackathon in the nextGEMS project.

> Hackathons are communal exploration, analysis and development activities – all various forms of ‘hacking’. They prioritize working together over lecturing one another. At NextGEMS meetings, our fingers will do the talking.”


Please join us for one week of hacking, finding bugs, fixing bugs, and a lot of fun from 14th to 18th October 2024 in Wageningen, Germany.
