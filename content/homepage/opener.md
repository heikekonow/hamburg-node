This will be the 4th km-scale hackathon. After three previous hackathons, mainly organized under the nextGEMS project, our hackathons now become even bigger. This time the km-scale hackathon will be co-organized by three projects: [EERIE](https://eerie-project.eu), [WarmWorld](https://warmworld.de), and [nextGEMS](https://nextgems-h2020.eu).

> Hackathons are communal exploration, analysis and development activities – all various forms of ‘hacking’. They prioritize working together over lecturing one another. At NextGEMS meetings, our fingers will do the talking.”


Please join us for one week of hacking, finding bugs, fixing bugs, and a lot of fun from 4th to 8th March 2024 in Hamburg, Germany.
