#### Accommodation

To help your search for accommodation in Hamburg, you can find a list of **[hotel options](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/c4HlclYFUgFGf9Q)**. 
For easier orientation, the list of hotels can also be viewed on **[Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NJGnAixVdawyriht8).**

#### Arriving by Plane
To get to the city center after your arrival at Hamburg Airport head to the SBahn station.
It is indicated by overhead signs showing a white 'S' inside a green circle. From there either take 
**S1** or **S11** in the direction of **Blankenese** or **Wedel**. Both SBahn lines will take 
you to the central station (in German: Hauptbahnhof), from there you find connections to all other SBahn lines, UBahn lines and many buslines for onward travel.

**Alternate Airports** 
- Bremen (BRE) - travel time to Hamburg Central Station up to 1h50min
- Hannover (HAJ) - travel time up to 2h30min
- Berlin (BER) - travel time up to 3h30min


#### Arriving by Train
If you choose to travel to Hamburg by train you will arrive centrally at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. 
To reach the MPI-Meteorology from there, head to the **U2** line (red line) in the direction of
**Niendorf Nord** or **Niendorf Markt**. After 4 stops exit at **Schlump**. 

When making your way out of the station keep 
an eye out for a large brutalist tower, the **Geomatikum**. From the station head then left
along the street **Beim Schlump** nearing the tower. Upon arriving at an intersection with a Shell petrol
station down to your left and a building under construction to your right, turn right across the street and
follow the road for 2 minutes until you spot a turquoise coloured glass building. You have found the
Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology. Entrances are located on both sides of the building.   
 


#### Transport passes for the week

Tickets for the Hamburg transport network (HVV) can be bought [online](https://hvv.de/en/onlineshop), in the 
[HVV-App](https://hvv.de/en/service/hvv-apps) or at the ticket machines found at almost every station. 

The network is segmented into rings from A to F. If you don't plan to travel far outside the city, purchasing 
regular tickets for zones A and B will certainly suffice. 

For the duration of the Hackathon a [weekly 24/7 ticket](https://shop.hvv.de/product/564/show) will be your cheapest option to travel around Hamburg.
