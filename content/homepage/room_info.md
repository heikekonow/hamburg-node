##### Rooms

The Hackathon is hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany (Bundesstr. 53, 20146).

Meeting rooms are distributed throughout the entire building. Here is a rough overview on which topic will be discussed in which rooms. If you get lost, ask someone local or come and find us in the library on the ground floor.
